- I just read another proof online and hated it (indices, yuck). 

- But I also found (and admire) this comment. Has all the ammo I needed.

    - *Yes, that's true, by the (i) universal coefficient theorem and (ii) the fact that for any finitely generated abelian group $A$ and any prime $p$, we have*
$$\dim_{\mathbb Q} A\otimes_{\mathbb Z}{\mathbb Q} = \text{rank}_{\mathbb Z}\ A = \text{dim}_{{\mathbb F}_p}\ A\otimes_{\mathbb Z} {\mathbb Z}/p{\mathbb Z} - \text{dim}_{{\mathbb F}_p}\text{Tor}^1_{\mathbb Z}(A,{\mathbb Z}/p{\mathbb Z}).$$
