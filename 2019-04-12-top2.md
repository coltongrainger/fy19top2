There's an announcement for the reading course in homotopy theory, which will probably will start with the "homotopy category" and fibrations.

## Pairings

We have a sign convention^[This is also (homologically) $\Hom(A_*, B_*)_{-p}$.] for the *maps of cohomological degree $p$*:
$$\Hom(A_*, B_*)^p = \{f_i \colon A_i \to B_{i-p}\}.$$
That is, if $f$ has cohomological degree $p$, then the chain map looks like
$$\xymatrix{
    A_{i+1} \ar[r] \ar[d] & B_{i+1-p}\\
    A_{i} \ar[r] \ar[d] & B_{i-p}\\
    A_{i-1} \ar[r]  & B_{i-1-p}}.$$

**Claim.** $\Hom(A_*, B_*)^p$ is a chain complex with differential 
    $$(\delta f) (a) = \partial (f(a)) - (-1)^{\deg f} f(\partial (a)).$$

*Why?* Consider the (chain map) element $f \in \Hom(A_*, B_*)$. Then $f$ is a cocycle if and only if $f$ has cohomological degree $0$.

**Corollary.** Consider the chain complex *concentrated at degree $0$*:
    $$G_* = \{0 \qq{ not in degree $0$ else $G$}\}.$$
With our sign conventions, the degree of each (chain map) element $f \in  \in \Hom(A_p, G)$ is $(-1)^{\deg f + 1}$. 
Therefore (by the previous claim)
    $$\Hom(A_*, G) \qq{ is a chain complex with differential }\delta f = (-1)^{\deg f + 1} f \partial.$$

Keep in mind that the resolution $F_*(G) \to G$ (for $G$ a finitely generated abelian group) induces a chain map.
$$\xymatrix{
    0 \ar[r] \ar[d] & F_1 \ar[r] \ar[d]  & F_0 \ar[r] \ar[d] & 0 \ar[d] \\
    0  \ar[r] &  0 \ar[r] &  G \ar[r] & 0 }.$$

### Cross products

Let $\Lambda$ be a commutative unital ring. 
Define 
    $$\times \colon \Delta^p (X; \Lambda) \otimes \Delta^q (Y; \Lambda) \to \Delta^{p+q}(X\times Y; \Lambda)$$ 
such that for (the cochains) $f \colon \Delta_p (X) \to \Lambda$ and $g \colon \Delta_q (X) \to \Lambda$ we have 
    $$f \otimes g \colon \Delta_p(X) \otimes \Delta_q(Y) \to \Lambda \otimes \Lambda.$$
But we can also map 
    $$\Lambda \otimes \Lambda \xrightarrow{m} \Lambda$$ 
so that $\sigma \otimes \tau \mapsto f(\sigma) \otimes g(\tau) \mapsto f(\sigma) g(\tau)$.

Recall from the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem (which is only *hard* for singular chain complexes generated on *spaces*), there's a map $\Theta \colon \Delta_*(X \times Y) \to \Delta_*(X) \otimes \Delta_*(Y)$ for which we have the chain homotopies $\Theta \circ \times \sim \id$ and $\times \circ \theta \sim \id$. 
Define
    $$f \times g = f\otimes g \circ \Theta.$$
Yu asked how 
    $$\Theta \colon \Delta_p(X\times Y; \Lambda) \to (\Delta_*(x) \otimes \Delta_*(Y))_p$$
could be well defined.

- Fix $f \colon \Delta_p(X) \to \Lambda$, 
- then extend to *all of* $\Delta_*(X)$ by varying $p$.

**Lemma.** $\delta (f \times g)  = \delta f \times g + (-1)^{\deg f} f \times \delta g$.

*Proof.* \TODO\ (via acyclic models.)

**Theorem.** There's a natural product 
    $$\times \colon H^p(X; \Lambda) \otimes H^q(Y; \Lambda) 
        \to H^{p+q}(X \times Y; \Lambda)$$
such that 
    $$f \otimes g \mapsto f \times g.$$

*Proof sketch.*
$$\xymatrix{
    \Delta_*(X \times Y) \ar[r]^\Theta &
        \Delta_*(X) \otimes \Delta_*(Y) \ar[r]^{f\otimes g} &
        \Lambda
}.$$

### Cup products

Define $1 \in H^0(X; \ZZ)$ to be the class^[What?] of $\epsilon \colon \Delta_0(X) \to\ZZ$.

From the product
$$\xymatrix{
    X\times Y \ar[dr]^{\pi_Y} \ar[r]^{\pi_X} & 
        X \\
    & Y 
}$$
we have the induced map on $H^*(X) \to H^*(X \times Y)$ taking $\alpha$ under $\pi^*_X$ to $\alpha \times 1$ (similarly $\beta \mapsto 1 \times \beta$).

In particular, consider the "slice map"
$$\xymatrix{
    \Delta_p (X) \otimes \Delta_0(X) \ar[r]^{\times} & 
        \Delta_p(X \times Y) \ar[r]^{{\pi_X}_\Delta} & 
        \Delta_p(X) \\
    \tau \otimes y \ar@{|->}[r] &
    (\tau \times y)(x) = (\tau(z), y) \ar@{|->} [r]& 
    \tau
}$$

\TODO\ Once extended linearly, we have a map on chains, therefore an induced map.

How can we compare $\alpha \times \beta \in H^*(X\times Y; \Lambda)$ to $\beta \times \alpha \in H^*(Y\times X; \Lambda)$?
There's a twist map $T \colon X \times Y \to Y \times X$ taking $(\alpha, \beta) \mapsto (\beta, \alpha)$,
which induces a map on cohomology
$$\xymatrix{H^*(X\times Y; \Lambda) & \ar[l]^{T^*} H^*(Y\times X; \Lambda)}.$$
*Note.* From this, one shows that the cup product is anti-commutative.

To finally define the cup product, we need the diagonal map $d \colon X \to X \times X$ such that $d(x) = (x,x)$. The induced map $d^*$ back on cohomology along with the map from the tensor product into the product (given by Eilenberg-Zilber) allow one to string together (this magic of topological spaces):
$$\xymatrix{
    H^*(X; \Lambda) \otimes H^*(X; \Lambda)  \ar[r]^{\times} & 
        H^*(X\times X; \Lambda) \ar[r]^{d^*} & 
        H^*(X; \Lambda)\\
    \alpha \otimes \beta \ar@{|->}[rr] & &
        \alpha\text{"cup"}\beta}.$$
