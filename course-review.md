I will try to reflect on four aspects of MATH 6220.

1. Knowledge-centered, e.g., what should I be able to do?

I believe I can now critically interpret, converse with my peers about, and solve problems related to 80% of the material covered in lecture or assigned for the problem sets. However, there are topics that I will finish the course either feeling uncomfortable with or that I wish would have been further explored. To distinguish these topics, I'll list what I can recall was covered in class, and wrap the hard/subdued 20% in parentheses.

- singular homology; face and boundary maps; categories Top, Ab, GrAb, Ch; functors Map, Sing_n, \Delta_*, H_*
- group theory review; Hurewicz homomorphism; examples with 0-, 1-, and 2-dim manifolds; functors H_0, H_1, \pi_1, (--)^ab
- relative homology; s.e.s.'s; l.e.s. of a pair; snake lemma; categories Top_pairs, (hTop_pairs), (triangulated Ch)
- Eilenberg--Steenrod axioms; definition of a co/homology theory with coefficients
- derivation of properties in an ordinary homology theory; definition of degree; homotopy classes of maps of spheres; example with antipodal map
- CW-complexes; cellular homology computes singular homology; examples with RP^n, CP^n, surfaces; (equivariant CW-complexes); (cellular maps); (cellular approximation)
- product CW-complexes; a cross product exists; acyclic models; verification of the homotopy axiom
- verification of excision; Euler characteristic; examples with 2-dim manifolds; (computations with simplicial homology); (proof of Meyer--Vietoris)
- transition to cohomology; free resolutions; (structure theorems for Ab, modules over PIDs); Ext and Tor; chain homotopies; (homotopy category of chain complexes)
- universal coefficients; Künneth theorem; examples with Euler characteristic, surfaces, (finite fields), non-natural splitting
- Eilenberg--Zilber theorem; Alexander--Whitney diagonal approximation; (Krönecker pairings); cup products; cap products
- topological manifolds; orientations; (maps of fiber bundles); (Poincaré duality)

2. Learning-centered, e.g., how have I refined my language and developed mental representations to "deal with" the course curriculum?

- In Jan/Feb, Algebra 2 and Topology 2 covered complementary material. I found that I needed write up many (~2 a day) arguments in module theory before I was satisfied enough to talk with other people about it. I was especially interested in Enochs' *Relative Homological Algebra*, but was burnt by spending too much time with it when both Algebra 2 and Topology 2 had moved on to different material in lecture.
- In Mar/Apr, I made deliberate effort to re-interpret DiffGeo 1 from an algebraic perspective. This proved to be hard, and not as related to Topology as I had hoped. I was quite interested in Hiro Lee Tanaka's notes, and talked a bit with Yu about them. (By late April, however, in DiffGeo 1 we eventually did define the de Rham complex. I was glad to have already given a rigorous description of the cap and cup product in Topology 2.) 
- All semester, if I didn't understand lecture, I would go to Bredon, eventually May, and re-read. 
- All semester, if I didn't understand my notes, I would compare with nLab and revise.
- All semester, if I had put together a skeleton idea, I would go to office hours or find Yu/Jonathan/Sam to flesh out the idea in conversation.
- Following the problem sessions, I would revise my lecture notes and problem sets against the published class notes and solutions.

3. Assessment-centered, i.e., how was I expected to reveal the progress I had made?

- I was glad to self-report for the problem sessions. Maybe add a short-answer in the google form for students to leave a note?

- I wonder if a (take-home?) midterm would be appropriate to demarcate the end of homology theory and the beginning of cohomology. For example, after sketching a proof of excision, it might have been effective to administer a midterm with questions on simplicial homology and the Mayer--Vietoris sequence.

- I wonder if it would be possible to schedule extra time so that each problem from each set could be presented in full. A 2 hour problem session seems unrealistic, but I imagine that students would have volunteered to meet outside of class to present those left over. Perhaps poll the students to find time for the leftover problems? 

- Or politely insist that students rotate after the end of a 15 min time limit, in order to cover 3 problems in the hour? I did feel a bit awkward to take 30 minutes for a shoddy presentation knowing that I was taking away the opportunity for, e.g., Ryan to present.

4. Community-centered, i.e., how did the course capitalize on the community of learners and society at large?

- I appreciated being asked for pronouns. 
- I appreciated being reminded of seminars.
- ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
